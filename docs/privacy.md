Galactic (stable) and Galactic Canary (testing) bots collect and store IDs in moderation logs and configuration. Message content is only ever stored by the bot when it is obvious from the use case to do so (typically this would be a configuration for something like a template message). Message content is not stored outside of the bot's working memory and never leaves the Discord context (except for the aforementioned case). Any message logs are purely based on output in channels at this time.

This text will be updated according should this ever change.

If the bot was to ever start collecting any data that is not absolutely necessary for its core functionality it will be opt-in.
