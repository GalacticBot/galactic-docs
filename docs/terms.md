These terms dictate the condition under which the Bots' (GalacticBot, GalacticTest, Galactic QA) services are provided to you. By using the bot you agree to the following:  
- You will use the bot in good faith.  
- You will not use the Bots for illicit or harmful activities.  
- You will not use the Bots to harass users.  
- You will not abuse the Bots' API or any APIs it uses should a vulnerability enable such behaviour.  

Also note that there are absolutely no guarantees of service uptime or availability, as this is a hobby project. That is not to say that I won't do my best to keep it up and running.  

Any egregious violations of reasonable conduct (as arbitrarily decided by the Developer(s)) will be met with revokation of access to use.  

Reporting abuse of the bot can be done through the support server, invite link down below in the footer.
